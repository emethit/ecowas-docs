# PREAMBLE

The purpose of this technical note is to support users of data relating to quality and industry generally in the world, in the ECOWAS region and more particularly in Mauritania. This note will allow you to familiarize yourself with and browse your MAUQUIB database. In addition, this note allows you to understand the information available and consultable on the one hand at the level of the MAUQUIB database and on the other hand the data expected for the entry of quality metadata, in particular on the MAUQUIB platform. Entering this essential and mandatory metadata is often experienced as tedious and complex by data producers. This note accompanies you in this task and allows you to devote yourself easily to the production of data at the level of the MAUQUIB platform. You will find definitions, recommendations and examples that will illustrate how to proceed.

This note seeks to be complete, it may be that features have been omitted or still require in-depth documentation. MAUQUIB is a web application and in most cases screenshots have been included for better understanding. As the application is constantly evolving, if the screenshots do not match, it is not a problem. Finally, different text styles are used to highlight important parts or particular types of text.

# INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this guide is to present the contents of the database relating to quality, industry and to give some practical advice on how to use this database. The database was produced thanks to the contribution of the European Union and the West African Competitiveness and Quality Infrastructure Project (WACQIP)[^1]. This is not a finished product; this database is an ongoing project that will be gradually enriched by new contributions. Despite the development of online library catalogs and databases, much bibliographic information is still found only in sources not available online, such as library catalogs, sector directories and journals, and needs to be collected by consulting journals, collections and series. One of the objectives of the MAUQUIB project is to make this information available to the public. The interest of this database is first of all to identify and store all the data collected in the various fields of quality and industry and on the other hand to make available different information in relation to what is done in terms of quality and industry in Mauritania. The establishment of this database therefore allows data users (policy makers, researchers, investors, students, etc.) to have a reliable source of data on the quality and industry of the Mauritania. Contributions, whether from researchers, students, policy makers or anyone interested in quality and industry, are welcome.

This document called "Explanatory note on the mode of operation of the Base" (feature guide for the MAUQUIB application) is intended for all users who will interact with the Database in a context of consulting data relating to the quality and industry of Mauritania and supply or integration of data in the Base. This note allows you to understand all the functionalities of the Base in its new first version and ensures better accessibility to the Base. This note comprises three (03) parts. The first part presents general information on the MAUQUIB database, the second deals with the functioning of the search for data at the level of the MAUQUIB database and in the third part, is exposed the functioning of the database relating to the entry and processing. importing data into MAUQUIB.

# I- GENERAL INFORMATION ON THE MAUQUIB DATABASE

The various general information concerning the MAUQUIB database are: the prerequisites for accessing the database, the startup and the home page of the MAUQUIB database, then the navigation menu in the MAUQUIB database.

# Prerequisites

This web database is developed on a platform installed on a web server. Its use will be detailed in the following sections. To have access to the MAUQUIB database, the user (policy makers, researchers, investors, students, database administrators, etc.) needs:

- an internet connection and

- a web browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.) and/or;

- a profile: having an administrator profile on the MAUQUIB portal allows its holder to identify and authenticate. This status grants him the authorization to enter, modify or delete data from the database. The administrator profile is automatically assigned to focal points in the field of quality, industry and other well-identified people. All administrators have a unique identifier and a confidential password. All other users (for example students, researchers, decision-makers) do not benefit from an administrator profile.

1. **Getting Started and Home Page**

![](./media/image7.png){width="5.892361111111111in" height="4.183333333333334in"}From a web browser, type the link https//mauquib.mr The figure n°1 below represents the home page of the application.

Figure 1: Screenshot of the MAUQUIB database home page

The home page presents the navigation menu in the MAUQUIB database.

# MAUQUIB Home Page Navigation Menu

The navigation menu allows you to browse the MAUQUIB database from a theme/sub-theme structure filtered by variables. Themes are accessed through the Themes framework. The navigation bar makes it easy to navigate through themes. The user selects a theme by clicking on the box bearing the name of the theme; the choice of sub-themes is done in the same way after having clicked on a theme which has sub-themes. The different themes offered in the navigation menu of the home page are:

- At the top of the home page, you have the following themes:

- Home / Accueil: to return to the home page when browsing the database;

- By the way: you have a brief description of the MAUQUIB database;

- Contact us: you can write to the person in charge of the Database

- External links: you have access to the Blog of consumer associations - Forum of consumer associations - Exchange forum between maintenance structures and laboratories;

- Browsing languages on the home page and in the database: three browsing languages are offered. This is ***ENGLISH,*** ***ENGLISH*** and ***PORTUGUESE***. The default navigation language is **ENGLISH**;

- Two data consultation interfaces: they are located in the central part of the database home page and provide access to statistics on quality and on the industry. These interfaces are part of the public space.

![](./media/image8.png){width="6.459722222222222in" height="0.9791666666666666in"}Figure 2: Partial screenshot of data consultation interfaces in MAUQUIB

- At the bottom of the page :

- Data entry: this sub-theme is the private area of the database. It is reserved for administrators;

- Send a comment: you can copy the email address to send a mail or click on the link to open your mail application to send a comment on the database.

If you have an administrator profile, you will be able to access the quality data entry forms through the DATA ENTRY menu on the home page. Industry data will not be entered. These data filled in on a model in Excel format, will be directly imported into the MAUQUIB application after a consistency check by the expert - contact of the Base within the Department of Statistics of the ECOWAS Commission.

# 1.3.1. Selection of themes

The user can navigate through the database via the navigation menu on the top of the MAUQUIB Data Portal. As mentioned above, MAUQUIB data layers are organized by themes/sub-themes. Users can navigate through the themes by simply clicking on the themes at the top. Indications are provided for each group of themes and sub-themes.

# 1.3.2. Selection of sub-themes

Once the theme has been selected, the corresponding sub-themes are available from an interactive pop-up window on the left side of the page**.**

# II- OPERATION OF THE MAUQUIB DATABASE: DATA RESEARCH

The operation of the MAUQUIB database is seen in two aspects: the search/query for data in the database and the entry of data into the database. In this part we describe how the database works in terms of data retrieval.

A user can search for two types of data in the MAUQUIB database. These are data relating to quality and those relating to Mauritania's industry.

This table contains, from left to right, the CODE column of the variable, those of the names of the VARIABLES selected and those of the data by search years specified during the query. Each of the rows of the table presents the results for each variable selected and are classified in alphabetical order from A to Z. The results displayed in the table concern only the variables for which at least one of the data relating to the period specified in the query exists. in the database. Thus, of the seven variables selected, data exist for five variables (PINEAPPLE, BANANAS, CASHEW NUTS, ONIONS and PLANTAIN). On the other hand, no data is available for the two variables CASSAVA and SWEET POTATO for the period from 2000 to 2019.
